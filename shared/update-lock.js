 *
 * Pure functions only, no chrome.* calls, so the service worker and the popup can
 * both import it and can never disagree about whether the extension is locked.
 *
 * Two ways to end up locked:
 *
 *   overdue  — the Web Store has a newer version and the user let the grace period
 *              run out. Deadline is `lastUpdateAt + GRACE_MS`.
 *   critical — the remote config (bg/remote-config.js) declares the running version
 *              below `minVersion` with `hardLock`, e.g. a security fix. No grace.
 *
 * MIN_GRACE_MS exists because the ordinary deadline is anchored to the last
 * *install*, not to the release: someone who has been sitting on the newest build
 * for two months would otherwise be locked out the moment a new version ships,
 * with no warning window at all. The deadline is therefore the later of "30 days
 * since you last updated" and "7 days since there was anything to update to".
