/**
 * undo.js — a recorded change → the SQL that puts it back, or applies it again.
 *
 * One shape carries every kind of change, because the rollback page has to treat
 * them alike: a change is a table plus a list of rows, and each row holds the
 * predicate that identifies it, the values it had (`before`) and the values it
 * was given (`after`). An UPDATE has both; a DELETE has only `before`, which is
 * the whole row; an INSERT has only `after`.
 *
 *   { op, table, schema, keyCols, rows: [ { where, before, after } ], warnings }
 *
 * Two rules here are the ones that keep an undo honest.
 *
 * First, the predicate. `where` is what Adminer used to *reach* the row, so it
 * holds the values from before the edit. If the edit changed a key column, that
 * predicate no longer matches anything — the undo has to look the row up by its
 * new key and set the old one back. `undoWhere()` does that swap, and only for
 * columns that are actually part of the key.
 *
 * Second, what is not undoable. A table with no key gives an empty predicate,
 * which would make an undo statement hit every row in the table. That is never
 * emitted silently: the change is marked `undoable: false` with the reason, and
 * the caller decides whether to offer the LIMIT 1 variant. The same goes for an
 * INSERT whose new key was never observed, and for a column the capture could
 * not read (a BLOB, a file input).
 *
 * The redo half is the mirror image: it writes `after` where the undo writes
 * `before`, and it reaches the row by the predicate Adminer recorded — which is
 * what the row holds again once the change has been rolled back. It needs values
 * the capture actually read back, so a statement typed on the SQL page, whose
 * `after` was never read, is refused rather than guessed at.
 *
 * Pure functions over plain objects — no DOM, no storage, no chrome API.
