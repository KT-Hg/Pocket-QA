 *   1. `chrome.permissions.request` needs a user gesture, and the action popup

 *      happen in a window that survives losing focus.
 *   2. Chrome registers a desktop stream against the *render frame* that called
 *      `chooseDesktopMedia`. Handing the streamId to any other context (offscreen
 *      document included) fails with "AbortError: Error starting tab capture",
 *      so `getUserMedia` must run in this very frame.
 *
 * The captured PNG goes to the service worker (WINDOW_CAPTURE_RESULT), which
 * reuses the normal watermark + naming + save/crop path.

 * Make Chrome re-measure the open picker dialog.
 *
 * The picker is a web-modal dialog, and it takes its size once, at creation —
 * when its source list is still empty and one row tall. The windows that stream
 * in over the next second do not resize the widget, so the dialog stays short
 * and slices the source labels off under the thumbnails, however many sources
 * eventually arrive. Anything that forces a re-measure fixes it, which is why
 * alt-tabbing away and back visibly corrects the dialog.
 *
 * The trigger reachable from here is a write to the host window's bounds:
 * UpdateWidgetModalDialogPosition re-reads GetPreferredSize() every time it runs,
 * and it runs whenever the host's bounds are set, because a web-modal dialog has
 * to stay centred on its host. The write does not have to change anything — the
 * window's own rectangle, written back to it, is enough — so nothing moves and
 * no focus is stolen, which would drop the dialog behind this window.
 *
 * Two earlier attempts are worth not repeating. Resizing by a pixel, and later
 * moving by a pixel, both worked on the dialog but were visible on the window:
 * two updates in a cycle are two round-trips through the browser process and
 * readily land in different frames, so the window twitched once per nudge. And
 * reading the window back between nudges is worse than useless: every
 * chrome.windows.update round-trips the bounds through device pixels and DIP, and
 * under a fractional display scale — 1.2999999523162842 on the machine this was
 * chased down on — that conversion rounds outwards by a pixel or two. Feeding the
 * result into the next nudge compounded it, growing the window 38x33 device
 * pixels over eight cycles. Hence: read the rectangle once, write it back whole
 * every time, and never read it again.
 *
 * Repeatedly, and front-loaded, because there is no event to wait for: the dialog
 * may not exist yet at the first nudge, and the source list keeps growing for a
 * second or two after it does. A nudge that lands too early costs nothing — it
 * re-measures a dialog that is already right, or none at all — so the schedule
 * starts as soon as the dialog can plausibly be up and thins out from there. The
 * gaps sit between nudges rather than counting from the start, since each write
 * is awaited before the next is allowed to begin.
