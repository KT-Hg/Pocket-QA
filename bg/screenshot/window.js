/**
 * screenshot/window.js — Window capture.
 *
 * The only capture path that photographs a whole OS window rather than a page:
 * Chrome with DevTools docked, but equally VS Code, a terminal, Figma, or any
 * other application. It goes through the OS compositor (`desktopCapture` +
 * `getUserMedia`) instead of `Page.captureScreenshot`, which by design never sees
 * anything outside the page viewport.
 *
 * The worker cannot do the capture itself: `chooseDesktopMedia` has no window to
 * anchor its picker to and bails with an empty streamId, and the resulting stream
 * is bound to the render frame that asked for it. So all this module does is open
 * capture-window.html and receive the finished PNG back from it.
 *
 * Owns its own onMessage listener for the same reason bg/screenshot.js does —
 * see the note on LOCKED_MESSAGE_TYPES in bg/router.js.

/**
 * Fallback size, used only the first time — big enough for Chrome's window
 * picker to fit inside.
 *
 * The picker is a dialog owned by the window whose frame called
 * chooseDesktopMedia, and Chrome shrinks it to fit that window — at the original
 * 460x260 the thumbnail grid ate the whole dialog and the Share button was
 * clipped off the bottom, unreachable unless the user maximised the window first.
 * The dialog's width is capped in Chrome (600dip) but its height is not: it is
 * squashed to whatever the parent's content area allows, which slices the source
 * labels off the thumbnails. So the page measures its own display and sizes
 * itself tall enough to hold the dialog whole (see targetBounds/applyBounds in
 * capture-window.js), remembering the result for the next open.
